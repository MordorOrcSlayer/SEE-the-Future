        SEE is an independent enterprise founded in 2030 to research and develop
        sustainable technologies. One of our core policies is to keep our research
        open to spawn intrest in sustainability and making it accessible.

        It was in the 1880s when coal was first used to generate electricity for
        homes and factories. By 1961, coal had become the major fuel used to
        generate electricity in the United States. Ever since then coal, oil and
        natural gases have been producing the majority of our energy. However,
        these are known as non-renewable energy sources, which means that there is
        a finite amount and they cannot be replenished.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, they produce greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases contribute to
        the greenhouse effect that absorbs and traps the sun's eat in the earth's
        atmosphere causing global warming. That is not the only harm they do to
        the planet. Extracting these resources more often than not hurts the
        environment.

        Renewable energy unlike non-renewable energy can be used without depleting
        it's source. While some composites used to make the infrastructures to
        arnest renewable energy does require us to risk hurting the environnement,
        the benefits far out weight the cons. For exemple we will someday run out
        of fossil fuels where as hydropower will carry on far into the future.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        The first major use of wind power that we've had was to push our
        sailboats. We still use wind in the same manner nowadays but now the most
        common way to utilise the wind's energy is trought wind turbines. These
        weren't always used to generate electricity though.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>1st century AD</strong> <br />
        The first records of a windmill being used was to power a machine. <br />
        Heron of Alexandria, a greek, made this wind turbine. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>7th to 9th century</strong> <br />
        In the Sistan region of Iran, near Afghanistan, windmills were used to
        grind corn, flour and to pump water. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>1000 AD</strong> <br />
        In China and Sicily, windmills were used to pump seawater make salt.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>1180s</strong> <br />
        The Northwestern nations of Europe start using windmills to grind
        flour.<br />

      <h3>How does a wind turbine work?</h3>
      <p>
        Air flow can be used to run wind turbines. Modern utility-scale wind
        turbines range from around 600 kW to 9 MW of rated power. The power
        available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as
        wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for
        the particular turbine. Areas where winds are stronger and more constant,
        such as offshore and high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind
        farms. Typically, full load hours of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57
        percent annually but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore
        sites.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in
        2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy
        was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and
        the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of
        its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly
        20%.
      </p>

      <p>
        Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to
        be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current
        electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome.
        This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas,
        particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore. As
        offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, so offshore
        resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed
        turbines.

      <h2>Biomass</h2>

      <p>

    Biomass is renewable organic material that comes from plants and animals. Biomass was the largest source of total annual U.S. energy consumption until the mid-1800s. Biomass continues to be an important fuel in many countries, especially for cooking and heating in developing countries. The use of biomass fuels for transportation and for electricity generation is increasing in many developed countries as a means of avoiding carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use. In 2020, biomass provided nearly 5 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) and about 5% of total primary energy use in the United States.

  Biomass contains stored chemical energy from the sun. Plants produce biomass through photosynthesis. Biomass can be burned directly for heat or converted to renewable liquid and gaseous fuels through various processes.

  Biomass sources for energy include:
      <ul> <li>Wood and wood processing wastesfirewood, wood pellets, and wood chips, lumber and furniture mill sawdust and waste, and black liquor from pulp and paper mills </li>

  <li>Agricultural crops and waste materialscorn, soybeans, sugar cane, switchgrass, woody plants, and algae, and crop and food processing residues</li>
        <li>Biogenic materials in municipal solid wastepaper, cotton, and wool products, and food, yard, and wood wastes</li>
        <li>Animal manure and human sewage </li>

      </ul>

      <h1 id="You-do">What can you do?</h1>
      <p>
        There are a few things that every individual can do to help reduce the
        over all use of energy. Some exemples are:
      </p>

        <h3>Reduce electricity use:</h3>
        <p>Althought you might not notice it, your home drains electricity on a
        constant basis</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Buy local foods:</h3>
        <p>Localy sourced foods helps the economy and reduces tranports such such and
        such...</p><br />
        <br />
        <h3>Use public transports:</h3>
        <p>While using a car can be more efficient and sometimes it's simply
        unavoidable, using public transports for day to day commute.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      <ul>
        <li class="temporary">Close the lights in rooms you're not using</li>
        <li class="temporary">Reduce the amount of hot water used</li>
        <li class="temporary">
          Don't let your electric devices charging once they are at 100%
        </li>
        <li class="temporary">Use public transports</li>
        <li class="temporary">Take the bike or walk for short distances</li>
